		<center><h1>Making Butter</h1></center>
		<p>&#160&#160&#160&#160Making butter is quite a simple process, and can be done without specialty tools. The three main steps are: separate the cream from the milk, churn the cream, and process the butter.</p>
		<p>&#160&#160&#160&#160First, you must separate the cream from the milk. To do this, it is proper to use a cream separator.   But if you are making a small amount of butter or you donâ€™t plan to make butter often, you can substitute the separator for a tray. To utilize this method, pour all of your milk into the tray and put it in the fridge.  Then, you must wait for about 5 days for the cream to rise.  After this time, nearly all of the cream should be floating on top of the milk.  The cream can now be easily skimmed off the top of the milk. Now you have cream and  the left-over skim milk.</p>
		<p>&#160&#160&#160&#160Next, you must prepare the cream for churning and churn it. If you decide to color your cream/future butter, take note that there are two methods to do so. The first, and more modern, method is to simply add butter color to the cream. Please note that food coloring will not work, as it is water based, while the cream is oil based. The second, old-fashioned way to color your butter is to heat shredded carrots in milk and add that mixture as dye. Now that your cream is colored, it is time to churn the butter.  There are generally three ways to churn butter, the first being the most proper:  a butter churn, a cake mixer, or a blender on low. Each one has their advantages and disadvantages: the butter churn, although the most proper way of churning butter, takes a lot of manual energy to churn. The cake mixer is the next best churner, and although it takes nearly no energy, the butter may splatter at the end of the process. The blender creates butter with the same consistency as the cake mixer, as well as being lightning fast, but butter must be churned in very small batches. Which ever method you choose, you will know when the butter is ready by watching for small, wheat-sized grains of butter to float to the top of the churning mixture. Once this happens, turn off the churner and move on to the next step.</p>
		<p>&#160&#160&#160&#160To finish the butter, first you must get the buttermilk out of it. To do this, first strain the butter, and, if desired, retain the buttermilk in a bowl. After the butter is drained, it must be thoroughly rinsed to get rid of any left-over butter milk. If this step is skipped, the butter will quickly become stinky, so be sure to rinse it well. Now, if desired, fold in salt until thoroughly mixed. Then, slightly warm the butter and place it in a mold. After that, refrigerate till hard, and there you are, homemade butter!</p>
		<p>&#160&#160&#160&#160To make butter, many different milk types can be used. Goat milk is fairly the same, but the cream is a little tougher to get out of the milk, and a cream separator should be used. The milk used to create butter must be fresh from the animal with no pasteurizing or homogenizing. The milk can be kept in the refrigerator until you have enough, but other than that, butter can only be make with fresh milk. In reality, it is not the milk that you need to create butter, but the cream. You can buy heavy whipping cream from the store, but that is not at all cost-efficient.
