        <center><h1>The Hound</h1></center>
		<p>&#160&#160&#160&#160One time, a train carrying 100 people and 20 cars raced through the dark Mississippi forest.  The hound, with its 10 luxurious passenger cars, 4 storage cars, 4 circus cars, a dining car, and stage car, was the best and fastest of its time. This spring evening, year 1999, six people sat around a dining car table discussing last night's tragedy.</p>
		<p>&#160&#160&#160&#160“Oh, my precious ring!” Matilda cried.</p>
		<p>&#160&#160&#160&#160“Don't worry, I'm sure you'll find it.” Allen said soothingly.</p>
		<p>&#160&#160&#160&#160“I don't thin-” Me and Deckla said simultaneously.</p>
		<p>&#160&#160&#160&#160“You can say it, Alfred.” Deckla said, trying to hide a laugh(as she always found it funny when two people said something simultaneously).</p>
		<p>&#160&#160&#160&#160“I don't think you lost it, I think it was stolen.” at that, everyone gasped.</p>
		<p>&#160&#160&#160&#160“But my bedroom door was locked!” Matilda said. “How could that be?”  Everyone thought about that, except for Veldar, who was nervously fiddling with his napkin.</p>
		<p>&#160&#160&#160&#160“I know!” Dale suddenly exclaimed. “Lock picks!” He then got out his lock pick set and proceeded to unlock his practice lock. Everybody pondered this notion as well as who could have stolen the ring while they finished their plates of food.</p>

		<p>&#160&#160&#160&#160“You're all wrong!” I said. “It had to have been lost.” I had a lock pick set too, and I DID NOT want to be suspected.</p>
		<p>&#160&#160&#160&#160“Well Veldar, how did Matilda lose it then?” Alfred said, somewhat accusingly. “Rings can't fly.”</p>
		<p>&#160&#160&#160&#160“Umm… Well… Uh..”</p>
		<p>&#160&#160&#160&#160“Exactly!  It couldn't have been lost!”</p>
		<p>&#160&#160&#160&#160“Humph. But there's no evidence.” I muttered.</p>
		<center><p>* * *</p></center>
		<p>&#160&#160&#160&#160The next morning, while these four thought about who could have stolen the ring and where Veldar and Dale where(as they had not shown up for breakfast) Three ladies a few tables over where celebrating the upcoming century.                         </p>
		<p>&#160&#160&#160&#160“Hooray for 2000!” they cheered.  Then, when the waiter came for the bill and and the three reached into their pocketbooks for their wallets... They could not find the wallets!  They searched franticly, but the wallets could not be found.  “There's a thief on the train!” one of the women yelled.  This came as a surprise to everyone on the train except for Matilda, Alfred, Deckla, Allen, and Veldar(who had mysteriously 'appeared' out of nowhere).  Security guards soon came to the three women and started asking questions like 'What color was your wallet?', 'How much money was in it?', and so on. Then Dale showed up.</p>
		<p>&#160&#160&#160&#160“huff, huff” he panted. “What's going on?”</p>
		<p>&#160&#160&#160&#160“Those women over there got their wallets stolen” Allen said sadly. “now they can't pay their breakfast bill.”</p>
		<p>&#160&#160&#160&#160“Well, well, well, too bad for them” Dale said, without a hint of pity.</p>
		<p>&#160&#160&#160&#160“Where were you, anyway?” Deckla asked.</p>
		<p>&#160&#160&#160&#160“Oh. Umm… I was sleeping in.” he replied, arousing suspicion.</p>
		<p>&#160&#160&#160&#160Suddenly, Matilda exclaimed “You're the thief! You have lock picks, your excuse for being late is quite lame, and it couldn't have been Veldar because he showed up right after the second robbery!” Before the six could sort this out, the security guards (who had happened to overhear) ran up and grabbed Dale.  They searched him and his room and came out with no evidence.  For the sake of things, they began to search everyone there. Veldar tried to quickly excuse himself and go to the bathroom, but the guards simply said no.  Then they found the ladies wallets in Veldar's back pocket!  They arrested him, gave back everybody's possessions, and everyone enjoyed a thief-less ride to Missouri.</p>
