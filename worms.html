		<center><h1>Raising worms</h1></center>
		<p>&#160&#160&#160&#160 Raising worms is something that may sound quite unusual. Many people may laugh at you when you tell them you raise worms. What they do not know is how profitable this can be. You can get tens of thousands of dollars a year raising worms, depending on the size of your operation. Now, let’s get into how to make that money.</p>
		<p>&#160&#160&#160&#160 First you will need to create an environment for your worms. You can put your worms in anything from a 5-gallon bucket to a large aquarium tank. Just be sure that the container you choose has good drainage, as worms can’t swim! You will also have to maintain the temperature of your worm bed, or you will have cooked worms. The worms should be at an average temperature of 55 degrees Fahrenheit. The worms will also need good bedding. A 50/50 mixture of peat moss and horse manure works best. There are a few steps to follow to prepare their bedding. First, you must cook the horse manure to get rid of all the insect eggs. The easiest way to do this is to put the manure into a halved 55-gallon drum placed over a fire. Next, let’s move on to stocking worms.</p>
		<p>There are a couple of ways to stock your worms. Here are the two most common:</p>
		<p>&#160&#160&#160&#160 1) Go to your local bait shop and buy a few dozen, or</p>
		<p>&#160&#160&#160&#160 2) Collect as many as you can on a drizzling spring night.</p>
		<p>It is best to start small, so that any mistakes made will be on a small scale. Once you are sure you are set up well, you can stock your worms at up to forty worms per cubic foot. Do not go any more than this, though, as worms do not like being overcrowded. Now, let’s move on to feeding the worms.</p>
		<p>&#160&#160&#160&#160 You can either buy worm feed or make it yourself. If you chose to make it your self, be mindful to mix different feed ratios for the breeder and the feeder worms. The feeders, worms being fattened up for the market, should be given a mix of</p>
		<p>&#160&#160&#160&#160 50% Cornmeal,</p>
		<p>&#160&#160&#160&#160 25% Ground nuts, and</p>
		<p>&#160&#160&#160&#160 25% High protein dry baby food.</p>
		<p>On the other hand, the breeders, the worms that make the feeders, should be given a mix of</p>
		<p>&#160&#160&#160&#160 75% Cornmeal, and</p>
		<p>&#160&#160&#160&#160 25% Ground nuts.</p>
		<p>In both mixes, you MUST add ground limestone to the feed to keep it from going sour. The correct dosage is about 10% of the weight of the feed mix, so if the feed mix weighs 10lb, add 1lb of ground limestone. You can also give your worms used coffee grounds, as it makes them muscular. Finally, we will talk about harvesting and selling your worms.</p>
		<p>&#160&#160&#160&#160 To harvest your worms, first you will have to extract them from their bedding and count them. To do this, put hand fulls of wormy bedding on the tray and, counting as you go, put them in your chosen container. To keep the worms moist, put a handful of wet moss on top of the worms. Worms are usually sold by the dozen, although you can sell them in large scale boxes of 500. Now, moving on to selling worms, there are generally  three places to sell your worms:</p>
		<p>&#160&#160&#160&#160 1) Sell them to your local bait shop,</p>
		<p>&#160&#160&#160&#160 2) Sell them to gardeners, or</p>
		<p>&#160&#160&#160&#160 3) Sell them directly to fishermen.</p>
		<p>When combined, all these outputs may earn you quite a lot.</p>
		<p>&#160&#160&#160&#160 In conclusion, raising worms is profitable, interesting, and fun. Here are a few tip and tricks to raising healthy worms:</p>
		<p>• Cover your worm beds to keep the worms from escaping.</p>
		<p>• Do not use pesticides to control flies, as the chemicals will harm your worms.</p>
		<p>• Keep worms well protected.</p>
