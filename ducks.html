		<center><h1>Ducklings</h1></center>
		<p>&#160&#160&#160&#160Once upon a time there was a small brown duck that lived in a large coop with two other ducks. She was tired of the humans that where always picky about where she lay her egg, so she decided to run away and make a flock of ducklings. She quickly ran into a problem. The humans would discover her and snatch her eggs if she made a nest any where they frequented. So, after glancing around to make sure no humans where watching, she headed into the forest to make a nest in a tree.  When she saw the situation in the forest, she was extremely dismayed. All of the good nesting spots where already taken. After much waddling around, she found a decent sized hole in the middle of a fairly short tree. She sized up the tree, backed up, and flew into the hole. After righting herself from her flight, turned nose-dive, she surveyed her new nesting spot. The hole was a fairly good home, but, as with most things, it would require a lot of work to make it optimal. She sighed, and went to collect nesting material.</p>

		<p>&#160&#160&#160&#160Meanwhile, back on the farm, the humans where frantic. None of them had an inkling as to where their favorite duck had gone. They searched everywhere, from the barn rafters to the chickens’ nest box, to no avail. As the humans where sadly coming to the conclusion that the duck had been eaten by a hawk, the other two ducks where talking things over.</p>
		<p>&#160&#160&#160&#160“Do you think she’ll survive?” asked one of the ducks.</p>
		<p>&#160&#160&#160&#160“I hope so. She was a good friend, if grumpy at times,” replied the other. “I just hope she doesn’t get eaten.”</p>

		<p>&#160&#160&#160&#160As it neared dark, the duck was putting the final touches on her new home. She quacked in a satisfied manner, and, after eating a few of the worms she had collected, fell fast asleep in her divot. The next morning, she couldn’t remember where she was and nearly squeaked in fright.  Soon though, she realized where she was and also the fact that she was very hungry. She reached for the pile of worms she had collected the night before only to find that they had all escaped. She quacked indignantly and went off in search of breakfast. As she waddled around, she caught sight of other animals going about their morning routine. She crashed through a line of bushes thinking she would find breakfast somewhere, and nearly fell off a ledge and into a pond. She stopped abruptly and side-eyed the pond. It did not seem to have anything dangerous in it, so she slid in and fished around for worms. After she had her fill, she realized she had to lay an egg. Rather than simply letting the egg drop, she hurried back to her nest, laid the egg, and began sitting on it. She did this for six days more, until she had seven eggs in her now well-worn divot.</p>

		<p>&#160&#160&#160&#160After four long, long weeks, the duck finally felt wiggling and thumping from the first egg she had laid. The duck excitedly peeked under her feathers to find that indeed, the egg had a pip! She waited very impatiently for the egg to hatch, and when it did, oh how positively CUTE! The wet duckling scurried under her wing to dry off but his mother did not mind. For the next five days one egg hatched per day, but the seventh egg simply would not hatch. She did not even feel it wiggling, so she decided to abandon that egg and be happy with the six ducklings she had. She quickly ran into three problems:  first, and by far most important, she had no clue how to get the ducklings down from her nest; second, the ducklings where hungry, as her stock of greens was extremely low; and finally, she did not know how to get back to the farm. The duck had an idea as to how she would get the ducklings down, so she began to execute the idea. First, she told one duckling to get on her back and firmly told the others to stay put. Then she ferried the duckling on her back to the ground and, after flying back up to the hole, got the other five ducklings down. Once the ducklings where all on the ground, she led the way to one of her favorite worm-munching spots and watched them chow down on worms. The first two problems solved, she turned her attention to the last problem: how to get the ducklings back to the farm. Once the ducklings where done eating, she whistled to them to follow her, and set off in the general direction she thought the farm was. The line of ducks had not gotten far when they ran into a small white mouse scurrying through the underbrush.</p>
		“Um, excuse me, Mr. mouse.” said the duck in a surprisingly mousy voice. The mouse gave a start and dubiously asked what she wanted. The duck asked where the human farm was, and the mouse stared at her incredulously.</p>
		<p>&#160&#160&#160&#160“Are you sure you want to go there?” sqeaked the mouse. After the duck confirmed that, indeed, she wanted to go to the human farm, the mouse pointed her in the right direction and ran off. Several minutes and many squeaky complaints later, she found the farm, and, with it, her coop. The duck looked back to do a head count, to find that there was one duckling missing. She panicked and ran back into the forest to find that the missing duckling was having a conversation with a frog. His mother quacked angrily and gave him a tug on his neck fuzz. As they walked away, the duck whistled a sad ‘goodbye’ to the frog and reluctantly followed his mother out of the forest. When they got out of the forest, the duck gasped. Her ducklings where nowhere to be found! She looked around, fearing the worst, and saw the ducklings at the human’s front door. The duck ran up to the human house, and, with a fair amount of scolding, she began pecking at the door. Four pecks later, the door opened. The small human stared at her, and then ran to get the other humans. They where all in awe when they saw the ducklings sitting very impatiently waiting to be fed. After that, the nine ducks lived happily ever after.</p>
